## Analysis Methods:

### Basketball Detection and Tracking:

#### Color Segmentation:

The system utilizes the HSV color space to enhance color representation, specifically targeting the yellow color associated with the basketball. Each frame undergoes conversion from BGR to HSV color space. Subsequently, a predefined HSV range is applied to create a binary mask isolating the yellow regions indicative of the basketball.

#### Morphological Operations:

To refine the binary mask and eliminate noise, morphological operations including erosion and dilation are employed. These operations aid in smoothing the edges of the detected object while effectively filling gaps within contours, ensuring the integrity of the basketball's representation.

#### Contour Detection:

Contours within the binary mask are identified using suitable algorithms. The largest contour is then selected as the representation of the basketball object, ensuring accurate tracking throughout the video.

#### Movement Tracking:

Velocity estimation is achieved by calculating the displacement between consecutive frames, providing insight into the basketball's movement. Bounces are detected through sudden changes in velocity, signifying impact with the ground and enabling precise tracking of the basketball's trajectory.

### Dribble Frequency Calculation:

#### Time Tracking:

Recording the initiation time of dribbling allows for accurate calculation of the elapsed time since the onset of the activity.

#### Bounce Count:

Throughout the video, the system tracks and counts the number of bounces detected, a fundamental metric for determining dribble frequency.

#### Frequency Calculation:

By dividing the bounce count by the elapsed time, the system computes the dribble frequency, providing valuable insights into the pace and intensity of gameplay. In scenarios where no dribbling has occurred, a default value of 0.0 is returned.

#### Dribble Velocity Calculation:

##### Previous Estimation:

The system retrieves the previously estimated velocity of the basketball, offering crucial information regarding its speed and direction.

##### Dribble Direction Detection:

###### Vertical Component Analysis:

By analyzing the vertical component of the basketball's velocity, the system determines the direction of dribble. A negative component indicates an upward movement, while a positive component signifies a downward motion. In cases where the vertical component is zero, the direction is labeled as "Unknown," ensuring comprehensive analysis of dribbling patterns.
